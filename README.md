# Year 2 Physics computing Project extension ICL
As part of the year 2 computing module at Imperial College London we were tasked to create a basic elastic gas simulation using python. I extended this challenge to try and simulate an adiabatic Joule-Thomson expansion within a container and piston ste-up. I am unable to upload all files for the simulation to run as younger students would be able to access them (and hence cheat).
